Healthcare Data Analysis & Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting healthcare costs using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital stay durations, and billing amounts.  

### **Project Workflow:**  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and calculating hospital stay durations.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing age distributions, billing amounts, and common medical conditions.  
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying relationships between key features such as age, medical condition, hospital stay, and billing amount.  
4. **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict hospital costs.  
5. **Evaluation & Insights:** Measuring model performance using MAE and RÂ², and exploring further improvements.  

This project provides a structured approach to understanding healthcare expenses and can be extended for deeper insights with additional datasets and features.
